Elegance and convenience combined with a bit of inner city grittiness. I have loved it all, since 1978!<br /><br />Mountjoy Square is situated just NE of the historic city centre, within walking distance of just about all the main city attractions. It is the most densely populated area in the entire city: 1500 people have front doors opening onto the Square.<br /><br />The house fronts onto a 4acre/1.5ha park, across a fairly busy street. This apartment faces the side street, so it is quieter, but you will still hear traffic.....Please bear in mind that this is NOT LEAFY SUBURBIA, but a vibrant, living city community and it's definitely gritty in places... Having said that, I have lived here, uneventfully, for nearly 38 years, and consider the trade-offs well worth it, for the excitement and convenience of having the city on my doorstep..",

St Patrick's Cathedral and Christchurch and Christchurch Cathedral are minutes away.  There is a great selection of traditional pubs and fashionable cafes.  <br /><br />Everything Dublin city centre has to offer is within walking distance.",

The Royal Canal passes only minutes away and is ideal for a jog, a stroll or a bike ride. A range of small independent shops are ten minutes walk away- great deli & gift store, fruit & veg store, fine butcher and fishmonger and a large supermarket ten minutes the other direction. Within 20 minutes you can walk to Dublin City centre and  the National Botanic Gardens- one of Dublin's treasures and Glasnevin Cemetery and Museum. Thirty minutes walk brings you to Phoenix Park (the biggest urban park in Europe) and Dublin zoo. The house provides easy access to numerous museums and galleries, including Collins Barracks or the Museum of Modern Art. The Gravedig",
